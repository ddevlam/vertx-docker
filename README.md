# vertx-docker
This project is a POC to demonstrate:
 * how to put some vert-x Eventbus consumers in separate verticles
 * how to put a simple http-server in a separete verticle
 * run al verticles in docker
 * expose only the HTTP server
 * cluster docker containers to talk to each other
 
## Why?
Started this project as I found it difficult to find a bare minimum to get this up and running.
